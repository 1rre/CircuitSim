# Sample Netlists

* [Netlist 1](/test_netlist_1.cir) features an exponential spike/decline voltage source in series with 2 resistors and a capacitor
* [Netlist 10](/test_netlist_10.cir) is the default netlist and features an AM voltage source in series with 3 resistors.
* [Netlist 100](/test_netlist_100.cir) features an undamped sine wave in series with 2 resistors and an inductor
* [Netlist 1000](/test_netlist_1000.cir) features an FM voltage source in series with 2 resistors and a pair of parallel resistors.
* [Netlist 10000](/test_netlist_10000.cir) features various voltage sources in parallel and series with various resistors.
